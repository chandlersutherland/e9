## Functions
Read in the excel file 
/Users/toniochaparro/Documents/Berkeley_Grad/Krasileva_Lab_Rotation/e9
```{r}
df <- readxl::read_xlsx(path="09122022_AtCDA1_AtCDAL1_ung.xlsx")

#remove too many or too few colonies
#not doing now since hand wavey test anyway and would lose all rif data 
##add if statement to do it for me
TITC <- df %>% filter(count=='TITC') %>% count()
TNTC <- df %>% filter(count=='TNTC') %>% count()
paste(TITC$n, "plates removed for insufficient colonies to count, ", TNTC$n, "plates removed for too many colonies to count.")
df <- df %>% filter(count!='TITC' & count!='TNTC')
df$count <- as.numeric(df$count)

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
